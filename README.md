All Social Network needs a database to store users, posts, friends and other. With this API the backend is ready to be used in any type of social media website and only needs to be downloaded and installed. As a webdevelper it is impportant to minize repetition and so having a backend build that can be reused is more than just convienient! This database was build using MondoDB and Mongoose which are both very new to me. I was able to learn more about them and now have an even better understanding of how to create a good database.
